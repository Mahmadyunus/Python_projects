# Python Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and related files for various data analysis, machine learning, and utility tasks. Below is an overview of the main files and their purposes:

## Contents

- **chatbot.py**: A Python script for a simple chatbot application.
- **data.csv**: Dataset used for data analysis or as input for scripts.
- **generate_report.py**: Script to generate reports, possibly using data from CSV files.
- **humidity_trend.png**: Visualization of humidity trends generated by one of the scripts.
- **sales_report.pdf**: Example of a generated PDF report.
- **spam_model_with_graph.py**: Script for building and evaluating a spam detection model, including graph generation.
- **spam.csv**: Dataset for spam detection tasks.
- **temperature_trend.png**: Visualization of temperature trends generated by one of the scripts.
- **weather_forecast.py**: Script for weather forecasting or analysis.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <https://github.com/Mahmadyunus/Python_projects.git>
   cd Python_projects
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   Some scripts may require external Python packages. Install them using:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If `requirements.txt` is not present, install packages as needed based on script errors.)*
3. **Run a script**
   ```sh
   python script_name.py
   ```
   Replace `script_name.py` with the desired script (e.g., `chatbot.py`).

## Notes
- Data files (`.csv`) are used as input for analysis and modeling scripts.
- Output files such as `.png` and `.pdf` are generated by the scripts for visualization and reporting.
- Modify the scripts as needed for your specific use case.
